## **2. The problem businesses can no longer ignore**

Ranking on Google is no longer enough.
Conversational AIs now deliver full, instant answers — cutting clicks to websites and bypassing even high-ranking pages.

Without AI optimization, you face:

* Falling organic traffic despite strong Google rankings
* Content that AIs can’t parse, extract, or cite
* Pages invisible to AI crawlers due to JavaScript-heavy builds
* Missing structured data preventing AIs from understanding your content

If your site isn’t built for LLMs, it’s invisible in a growing share of user searches.

## **3. Search behavior has already changed**

Ask yourself: when you need quick answers, do you go to Google first — or do you ask ChatGPT?

Your customers, or your clients’ customers, now:

* Start with conversational AI for speed and clarity
* Trust answers that cite credible, structured sources
* Rarely click through to results that AIs don’t surface

**If your pages aren’t visible and understandable by LLMs, you’re simply not part of the conversation.**

## **4. The solution: GEO Analyzer**

GEO Analyzer is the first audit platform built for **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** — the process of making your site **visible and understandable by LLMs** so it can be cited in AI-generated answers.

It scores your site against **89 criteria across 5 key dimensions**:

1. **Discoverability** – Can AI engines find you?
2. **Structured Data** – Is your schema complete and consistent?
3. **LLM Formatting** – Is your content ready to be cited?
4. **Accessibility** – Can every crawler and user access it?
5. **Readability** – Is it concise, clear, and modular?

You get:

* A **clear score and breakdown**
* Every blocker to your AI visibility
* **Actionable, prioritized fixes** to make your pages visible and understandable by LLMs

Few businesses are doing GEO today. **Start now and you can own the AI search space before it goes mainstream.**
